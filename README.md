# cstl

Basically just a C standard library with useful things I think. Documentation lowkey sucks but I'll work on that.

TODO:
- Create StringView for read only slices of strings (done)
- Create View for general purpose slices of Vectors and Arrays (done)
- Deque, TreeMap, TreeSet (done), HashMap, HashSet
- Algorithm -> sort, transform, reverse, find, copy, fill, accumulate
- Wrap containers with an Iterator abstraction (have each iterator hold a function pointer for the ++operator)
- Include CTX macros to auto close structures
